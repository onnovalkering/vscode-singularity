# Apptainer/Singularity

This extension provides syntax highlighting for Apptainer/Singularity definition files.

## GitHub
Syntax highlighting of Singularity definition files on GitHub is also based on this extension. 
Currently, only files that have `Singularity` as the exact file name are recognized. 
To recognize other files, e.g., `Singularity.*` and `*.def`, a `.gitattribute` file with additional rules/patterns can be added to GitHub repositories ([example](https://github.com/onnovalkering/vscode-singularity/blob/master/.gitattributes)).

The `interpolation`, `keyword`, `string`, and `variable` patterns (Bash) originate from [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
